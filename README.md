# Jogger: The Jaywalking Simulator

Jogger: The Jaywalking Simulator is top-down 2-dimensional game inspired by the 80â€™s classic, Frogger. What makes Jogger great? The object of the game is not to successfully cross the busy, Ferrari-riddled street but rather to stay in the street as long as possible without being splattered!

Take control of the classic Seinfeld character, George Costanza, as you attempt to spend time in the busiest Manhattan Ferrari street in existence. 

Avoid speedsters as you scramble to survive the deadly road!
